# Bayesian Inference pipeline
This repository contains C++-based simulation modules [Murmu et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.2500M/abstract), C-based power spectrum computation tools [Murmu et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.2500M/abstract), and Python scripts that integrate these components into an ```emcee```-driven MCMC pipeline for cosmological data analysis using Bayesian inference.
